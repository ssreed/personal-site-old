A New Beginning
====================

Ruby on rails, a popular framework for Ruby (duh!), is documented rather well and has a great community; however, if you don't know Ruby then Rails will be slightly difficult to learn. In addition to learning simple Ruby syntax, this full stack framework also introduces concepts that are unfamiliar to me. They include, but aren't limited to, *ActiveRecord*, *Migrations*, *Fixtures* and *Scaffolding*. I intend to use my free time to get myself acclimated to this incredible framework in hopes to build some interesting web applications.
