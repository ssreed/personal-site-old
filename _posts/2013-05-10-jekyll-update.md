Like the other blogs I started, I've figured a way to neglect this one. Although the idea of blogging is an intriguing one, I always find myself losing the desire to post consistantly. I always say to myself "This time it will be different, this time I'll be sure to post more consistently!" Of course, that promise is never kept. In order to ensure consistency I decided to scale down my intial goal of posting once a day to posting at least once a week.
